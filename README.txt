# GobletGobblers
  Object of the Game
  Like Tic-Tac-Toe, you must be the first player to get 3 pieces in a row to win.

    Game Play
      Each player chooses a color. Then, in turn, you can either:
        * Put a new Gobbler on the board, on an empty space or over a smaller Gobbler.
        * Move one of your Gobblers already on the board to an empty space or over a smaller Gobbler.

    End of the Game
      If you are the first player to get 3 pieces in a row, you win!
